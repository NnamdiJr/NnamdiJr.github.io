<p>I'm an NLP Engineer (<i>in the making</i>) living in San Francisco.</p>

<p>This blog is where I write about projects I'm working on, and clear out my thoughts on random <i>"stuff"</i> in an attempt to better organize it all in my head (<i>which usually fails</i>).</p>

<p><b>Interesting Info:</b><br>
<ul><li>My favorite snacks are KitKats (<i>the European ones by Nestle, <b>NOT</b> the rubbery tasting ones made by Hershey's in the US!</i>) and Jamaican beef patties.</li>
<li>I speak 3 languages other than English. Two fluently, and the third like a college professor with Aphasia (<i>..I'm working on it tho</i>)</li>
</ul>
