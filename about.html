<p>I'm an NLP Engineer (in the making) living in San Francisco. This blog is where I write about projects I'm working on, and clear out my thoughts on a bunch of "stuff" in an attempt to better organize it all in my head (which usually fails).</p>

<p>Interesting Tidbits: My favorite snacks are KitKats (the European ones by Nestle, NOT the rubbery tasting ones made by Hershey's in the US!) and Jamaican beef patties. I speak 3 languages. Two fluently, and the third like a professor with Aphasia (..but I'm working on it)</p>
