<p>I'm an NLP Engineer (<i>in the making</i>) living in San Francisco.</p>

<p>This blog is where I write about projects I'm working on and other random topics in order to better organize my thoughts (<i>..or at least that's the idea</i>).</p>

<p><b>Some Things About Me:</b><br>
<ul><li>My favorite snacks are Jamaican beef patties and KitKats (<i>specifically the European ones made by Nestle. Hershey's Kit Kats taste like rubber..</i>)</li>
<br><li>I speak Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. The first two fluently, and the third like a college professor with aphasia (<i>..working on fixing that though</i>)</li>
<br><li>You'll notice I like to use ellipses a lot when writing.... it's just something I do (<i>..so get used to it</i>)</li>
<br>This is an ongoing list. Message me if you've met me and discovered one I forgot.
</ul>
