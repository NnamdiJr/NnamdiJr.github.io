<p>I'm an NLP Engineer (in the making) living in San Francisco. This blog is where I write about projects I'm working on, as well as clear out my thoughts on a bunch of random "stuff" in an attempt to organize it all in my head better.</p>

<p>Randon Tidbits: My favorite snacks are KitKats (the European ones by Nestle, NOT the rubber tasting Hershey's ones from US) and Jamaican beef patties. I speak 3 languages. Two fluently, and the third like a professor with Aphasia (but I'm working on it)</p>
