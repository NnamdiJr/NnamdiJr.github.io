<p>I'm an NLP Engineer (<i>in the making</i>) living in San Francisco.</p>

<p>This blog is where I write about projects I'm working on and random thoughts, in an attempt to better organize it all in my head (<i>which often fails</i>).</p>

<p><b>Some Things About Me:</b><br>
<ul><li>My favorite snacks are KitKats (<i>the European ones by Nestle, <b>NOT</b> the rubbery tasting ones Hershey's makes in the US!</i>) and Jamaican beef patties.</li>
<li>I speak 3 languages other than English. Two fluently, and the third like a college professor with Aphasia (<i>..I'm working on it tho</i>)</li>
</ul>
