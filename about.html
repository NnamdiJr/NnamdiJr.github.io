<p>I'm an NLP Engineer (<i>in the making</i>) living in San Francisco.</p>

<p>This blog is where I write about projects I'm working on and other random topics in an attempt to better organize my thoughts (<i>which often fails, sadly</i>).</p>

<p><b>Some Things About Me:</b><br>
<ul><li>My favorite snacks are Jamaican beef patties and KitKats (<i>specifically the European ones made by Nestle, cuz Hershey's makes 'em taste like rubber..</i>).</li>
<li>I speak Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. The first two fluently, and the third like a college professor with aphasia (<i>..but I'm working on it</i>)</li>
<li> I use ellipses heavily when writing... because my thoughts tend to be the same.... trailing off... and then popping back up..... unexpectedly</li>
<br>This is an ongoing list. Message me if you've met me and discovered one I forgot.
</ul>
