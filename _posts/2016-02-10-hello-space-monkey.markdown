Wow, it's surprsing just how easy it is to create a website nowadays.

I remember when I was in high school and spent weeks (_maybe months_) learning html, hacking on whatever free website templates were out there, and going crazy trying to figure out how to put all the pieces together, and all that just to get a crappy basic looking page _that was mostly text_.

Since then, a lot has changed... now you can get a great looking site up in minutes. I spent not much more than an 1hr total to get this site ready, and there are other [tools](www.wix.com) out there now that allow you to do it even faster.

+ ~10min on GoDaddy for domain name
+ ~15min on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting
+ ~40min reading [Jekyll tutorial and documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)

That said, the hardest part isn't actually building a site anymore, it's avoiding procrastination and actually sitting down to write something in it!.

So what's this site gonna be about? ~~I'm not really sure, maybe twerking?~~ A unique perspective!

As you can guess from the front page tagline, I'll hopefully be writing mostly about Data Science & NLP. If that means nothing to you think **_text_**! Lots and lots of big ol' juicy text.. comments, reviews, tweets, speeches, etc. and everything that's hidden beneath the words.

The goal here is to tackle unique topics and ideas, id est the kind that would never see the light of day from the "_usual data science community-", and present them in a hopefully entertaining yet enlightening way.

So, stay tuned! and thanks for reading!

=)
