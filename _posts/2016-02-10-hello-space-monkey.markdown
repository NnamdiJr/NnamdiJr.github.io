Wow, it's surprsing just how easy it is to create a website nowadays.

I remember when I was in high school and spent weeks (_maybe months_) learning html, hacking on whatever free website templates were out there, and going crazy trying to figure out how to put all the pieces together, and all that just to get a crappy basic looking page (_mostly text_).

Since then, a lot has changed... now you can get a great looking site up in minutes. I spent just a tad bit more than an 1hr total to get this site ready.

+ ~10min on GoDaddy for domain name
+ ~15min on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting
+ ~40min reading [Jekyll tutorial and documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)

That said, the hardest part isn't actually building the site anymore (_done a couple weeks ago_), it's sitting down and writing something in it! (_doing now_).

So what's this site about? Perspective!

As you can guess from the front page tagline, I'll be writing mostly about NLP & Data Science. If that means nothing to you think Text! Lots and lots of juicy text.. comments, reviews, tweets, speeches, etc. and everything that's hidden in the words.

The goal here is to tackle unique topics and ideas, id est the kind that would never see the day of light from the "usual data science community" (_see: non-black_), and present them in a hopefully entertaining yet enlightening way.

So, go forth! and thanks for reading!
