Short post for a short week.

Thursday was of course Thanksgiving, so we had a much needed 4-day holiday weekend. Which I spent the majority of sleeping (_..and doing a little probability review_).

## Assessment 02:
On Tuesday we took our second assessment on general Python, Pandas, and SQL. Felt pretty comfortable with these topics but I think I'll invest in improving my speed recalling Pandas functions/syntax, as well as getting more familiar with the more advanced parts of Pandas.

It looks like going forward we'll be doing most of our data manipulations in Pandas, so it'll probably be extremely helpful to be able to recall functions much faster than I currently can.

As they say, even the most powerful tool is only as good as the person who wields it!

## Week 02 Topics:
We covered Sampling and Estimations ([MLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation), [MOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_moments_(statistics)), [KDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation), etc.) this week, as well as plotting in [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/).

Sampling/Estimations (_along with probability_) is one of those topics that I must have fallen asleep at during Stats101 in college since it feels like I have absolutely ZERO grounding in it. Definitely gonna need to put in some werk for this...

Plotting on the other hand is pretty dam cool. Matplotlib and Seaborn are impressive packages, and there's a ton you can do visualization wise with both. I think the eye for good visualizations and design is more an art than anything else, but as it's one of the few things in data science we can point to and show people (_and can actually look beautiful_) it's worth the practice to get a feel for it.

## Weekly Calls:
This week I also started weekly calls with my mentor/guide at Airbnb, who also went through Galvanize's DSI program (previously known as Zipfian).

The calls will obviously help me prepare to enter Airbnb, but even more than that, it's **_unbelievably_** valuable to be able to ask someone who went through the program and is currently working in industry which topics are especially important in practice and also get specific examples of Airbnb's workflow for those topics.

Pure gold.


Til next week.
