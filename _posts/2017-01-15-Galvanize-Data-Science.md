Writing this just after watching the movie _Hidden Figures_ and, man, saying it was an inspiration is an understatement.

The movie was a good reminder of the struggles faced by those who came before me, and really put my own "_challenges_" in perspective. Makes you think "_Well dam, if they could do it when things were like that, this right here should be easy for me!_"

# Week 08 Topics

Week 08 was our last full week of lectures, so for the remaining weeks all we really have left is to bust out our capstone projects. 

This week was all about distributed computing, with topics being _**MapReduce, Apache Spark, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Graph Theory**_.

In terms of importance to a Data Scientist's tool belt, I'd place the topics this weeks in the top 3.

You see knowledge of some kind of "_Big Data_" squashing distributed computing framework (_usually Hadoop and/or Spark_) and AWS as requirements in the majority of Data Scientist job postings, so if you're looking to get hired somewhere, you'd best get comfy with them.

Conceptually, it's not too hard to understand.. split up your tasks across a bunch of computers then combine the results at the end.

In practice tho, it's tougher, since it takes a bit of mental gymnastics to understand the operations and what exactly is happening when, correctly, in code form.

Overall, it's a very useful tool to know and I think my street cred went up a couple points just by being able to say that, I too, can tackle the mystical "_Big Data_".

What was most definitely **NOT** cool is the difficulty of getting Spark set up on AWS!

Galvanize instructors (_while complaining about this issue with Spark _) had a long list of detailed step-by-step instructions on how to get Spark running for Macs, and it **_STILL_** took most students many attempts over many hours to get it installed...

Now imagine the plight of the solo Windows user trying to navigate this mess on his/her own. 
<br>Nightmare.

A little strange, about a year ago when I had initially tried out Spark, I followed the O'Reilly _[Learning Spark](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028512.do)_ book and got it set up fairly smoothly. But I guess a couple new versions later and adding features can break things... lots and lots of thangs. 
 
To the Spark developers, I know you're busy creating such a great framework and all, but could'ya let us know, at least for each of the 3 major OSs, which version of the dam thing we're supposed to download?? Thanks.

#Capstone Projects

We also submitted our final project proposals this week.

I didn't attach a lot of importance to this, since time is short, and I wanted to use it reading up on all those fancy big data topics from above.
 
I really didn't think it was worth stressing out about writing an impressive 5-page project proposal, that's not being graded and only Galvanize instructors will ever see, when the key deliverable (_oOoo~ look at me using businessy vocab!_) is the presentation, and maybe also the project's final GitHub repo.

Like they told us at the beginning of the program, this **_isn't_** high school.

The important progress I made with my project this week was making sure I could actually collect the data I need by writing a scraper for one dataset I'll be using (_[UrbanDictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/)_), and making a few practice API calls to the other (_[Genius](https://genius.com/)_).

Next step, do a bunch of EDA.

# Meetups

A lot of really good meetups are held at the Galvanize building, and the faculty push us to go to meetups often.
 
One of these was hosted this week by Jeff over at [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com).

The title of the meetup (_something about Antifraud Infrastructure_) almost put me off it, but during a last minute second look, to my surprise, I found out two people I've wanted to meet for a long time were actually speaking at the event.

One was _Haseeb Qureshi_, who's superb blog posts on ["_How to Break Into the Tech Industry_"](http://haseebq.com/how-to-break-into-tech-job-hunting-and-interviews/) will inspire anyone on the job hunting grind. The usual eye-catching line is that he negotiated his starting salary from **120k** to **250k**, but there's a lot more to be gained than how to negotiate if you read through his posts.
<br>(_does anyone else cringe when they re-read **[extremley cheesy comments they wrote](http://haseebq.com/how-to-break-into-tech-job-hunting-and-interviews/#comment-2973)** a half year ago?_)

The other was _Courtland Allen_, the guy behind [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com), a website collecting the learning and experiences of founders of many different money-making apps that we've never heard of since they are too small to ever be talked about by the tech press.

I've been hooked on the IndieHackers site since it launched, because you never hear the stories of these "_lifestyle_" business founders and... real talk, who wouldn't want to make an extra couple [stacks] or even benjamins (http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=stack) each month on a side project? (_matter fact, my 2017 new years resolution_).

Meeting these two face to face after the talks and picking their brains, was probably be the highest value 30 minutes I will have this month.

I wish I could go to more of these meetups, at least as often as I used to, but usually by 7pm when the day at Galvanize is over, all I really want to do is go home and get something tasty in my stomach.

So the lesson to you reading is, check [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) for interesting groups and meetups (_don't let lame event titles throw you off, always look at the speakers!_) and go to them when you can.

Cuz you never know which encounter could lead to your next big hustle..

Le's get it!
