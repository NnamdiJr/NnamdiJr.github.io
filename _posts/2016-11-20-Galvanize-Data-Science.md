This week went like a blur...

Monday started off with orientation and getting to meet some instructors and the other members of my cohort. Then we took our first assessment test covering stuff we did in the precourse work.
<br>After that they went through logistics and what our daily schedule would look like. From Monday afternoon we basically dove right into what would become our daily class routine.

## The Cohort:
When I arrived for orientation, I noticed a couple things:

+ About half the group are women 
+ There's a wide age range among students 
+ Students come from many differnet backgrounds 

Everyone is coming into the program with a different story for how they got here, at different points in their lives, and from different countries.

This is awesome IMO and after getting to know a large part of the class this week, it sounds like each person is interested in applying data science to something different, which makes me excited for our capstone projects at the end of the program.

As a curious person, you can't beat learning what problems are important to someone from a totally different walk of life than you.

## The Lectures:
The structure of our day is a little different than previous cohorts.

It's split into two parts, a morning 1-hour lecture on the topic of the day, followed by "_Breakout_" and individual "_Sprint_" sessions. Then in the afternoon, there's another 1-hour lecture delving a bit deeper into the day's topic, followed by another breakout and ["_Pair-Programming_"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) sprint. 

During sprints, we either work individually or in pairs at the computer lab, going through coding exercises on that day's topic.
Breakouts on the other hand are kind of like those review sessions in the TA's office after a lecture in college, where you play around with and chew on what you've just learned in tiny little bites. 

## The New E-D-U:
At the end of the week there was a Meet And Greet where we got to talk with students from the previous cohorts currently finishing up their projects and getting ready to graduate. I learned that our daily schedule is a result of feedback Galvanize got from students in the cohort just before us. They had complained that too much time was spent just sitting in lecture and that they needed more hands on time with problems.

This is pretty amazing to me and is a testament to how Galvanize and other new education paradigms (Bootcamps, MOOCs, etc.) are embracing the... umm... "startup-ification" of education (_not sure what else to call it_). 
<br>Experiment, learn, and quickly adapt from your students performance/feedback.

Gives you hope for the future of education.

## Week 01 Topics:
This week we covered OOP in Python, SQL, Pandas, and a little probability. 

Of these, OOP was probably the roughest. Although not hard to understand conceptually, trying to actually code up something complicated can be mind-twisting...

Probably the coolest thing covered this week was the [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/) package, a library that lets you access PostgreSQL from within Python. Although I've done tons of SQL before, I've never done it from Python, and didn't really know how that all worked. So it was pretty cool to learn it.

## Wrap Up:
This may change as the program progresses, but so far, it seems the biggest difficulty isn't the material we are covering, it's getting used to the course's intense pace.
 
We're covering a new topic each day, and as much as I'd like to finish every single exercise (_more is usually given than can be done in the allotted time, for a newbie_) or go back and read something more in-depth, there isn't enough time for that. So I have to be satisfied that I generally "_got it_", and know where to look if I ever wanted to do more.

Overall, not a bad first week on the fundamentals, but I'm looking foward to getting deeper into the more meaty data science topics!
