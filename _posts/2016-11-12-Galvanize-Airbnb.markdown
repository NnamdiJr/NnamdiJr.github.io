Soooo... [Galvanize's Data Science Immersive (DSI)](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/data-science). How the heck did I get here?

## The Backstory
Well, since about a year and a half ago when I landed in SF, I've been somewhat aimlessly hopping between contract data analysis gigs.
<br>You see, I had my crosshairs set on a very small handful of companies (_just 2 to be exact_), but didn't feel my skills were good enough to get in... so the next best thing (_i.e. killing time while still being able to pay the bills_) was to take on contract gigs and learn what skills I could on my own, while waiting for the _right_ opportunity to present itself.

## The Opportunity
It took some time, but that opportunity finally came in the form of Airbnb's Data Science Associate (DSA) program. The program is basically a kind of partnership between Airbnb & Galvanize, where only **6** qualified individuals are selected from groups underrepresented in Data Science/Tech, and get a large scholarship to go through Galvanize's 3-month DSI program. Then afterwards, go into a 3-month apprenticeship on Airbnb's Data Science team. 
<br>Yea, pretty awesome right?

Oh, how did I hear about it you ask?
<br>**Answer**: I was STALKING Airbnb's careers page for over a year of course!

About twice a week I poked around the [Data Science & Analytics Dept](https://www.airbnb.co.in/careers/departments/data-science-analytics) page looking at positions and asking myself whether I should apply or not, when one day.. surprise surprise! A program specifically created for me pops up! 
<br>(_*Here would be a wonderful time to talk about the issue of minorities in DS/Tech, but I'll put that on standby for another post..._)

## The Interviews
Like a [cheetah hyper-focused on chasing its prey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuyeVN7PuTM), I was locked-on to getting into the program, and I had to move fast, cuz remember, only 6 people get in (_literally thousands apply to any single Airbnb opening on LinkedIn alone and I assumed this would be no different_). 
<br>After shooting off my applications (_well, not so much shooting off, the application essays and questions were things I had gone through in my head a million times before, so were easy to write_) the issue was now to pass the Galvanize and Airbnb interviews.

<br>Galvanize sends prospective students a ton of prep material before the interviews, so for the future Galvanize DSI students reading this, rather than telling you exactly what goes on during each step of the interview I'll just say that if you go through all the prep material they send, **_thoroughly_**, you can definitely pass the interviews. The big caveat being, if you have not had any exposure to coding before, you should probably spend a good chunk of time on that before applying.
<br>Galvanize interview steps:
<ul>
<li>Initial take-home assignment</li>
<li>Python interview</li>
<li>Math/Probability/Stats interview</li>
</ul>

For me, my Probability and Stats knowledge was **extremely** rusty and was the step I was most worried about failing pathetically. So I made sure to watch Khan Academy's [Stats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhxtUt_-GyM&list=PL1328115D3D8A2566) & [Prob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzkc-qNVoOk&list=PLC58778F28211FA19) playlists a few times (_is 10x still considered a few?_) leading up to that part of the interview. 
<br>Luckily, it was enough to pass and I got my acceptance email a day or so after.

Next step, Airbnb.
<br>After getting the initial call, Airbnb sent me a take-home challenge with accompanying dataset, giving 72 hours to complete it. The problem wasn't too complex so it wasn't hard to finish given the time allowed, but there were a couple hidden nuggets in the data that could have easily been overlooked if I had not been wary of the nitty gritty details. I think finding these were key to making it to the next round. _Shout-outs to R and the [Hadleyverse](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/03/hadleyverse.html) for helping make that happen!_
<br>After that, was 2 back-to-back interviews over Skype with Airbnb employees. 
<br>One light technical interview, and another more behavioral one on alignment with Airbnb's values. Both interviews were fairly straightforward and it was fun talking with the interviewers, so afterwards I felt pretty strongly I had done well.
<br> ...and I was right! About a week later I got the call that I got the scholarship.
<br>Hoooray!

## The Financing
On the other hand, if I hadn't gotten the Airbnb scholarship, there was NO way I could have afforded the DSI program, period.

<br>But now that I did have it, I had to worry about paying for the small (_but still relatively large for a broke a** like me_) remaining tuition. For a reference point, I hustled and struggled **_just_** to get the enrollment deposit paid... so _that_ being my situation, I was rightly panicked about the rest of the tuition and I doubted I would qualify for any kind of educational loan.

I kept thinking it would be **REALLY** f*cking sad if I made it this far but couldn't go through the DSI just because of money, but once again, luckily, I found out that one of [Galvanize's Tuition Assistance partners](www.galvanize.com/scholarships) gives accepted students a kind of 'benefit-of-the-doubt' loan (_makes sense, considering Galvanize's high post-graduation placement rates and salaries_). 

This saved my a** and I'm **extremely** greatful to both Galvanize and SkillsFund for having that agreement in place.

## Precourse
With all the acceptance stuff out of the way, I was added to a GitHub repo with precourse materials to work on. It took me a couple days to complete, and the Stats section made me feel like a huge idiot, but I got through it and think it was good practice.

After submitting it, all that was left was getting ready for Day01 on Monday.

## Leggo!
All that said, I'm just really hyped to have the chance to study nothing but data science, machine learning, NLP... pretty much all the things I love, like a madman for the next 3-months in a great program.. AND THEN.. immediately after that get to work with an amazing startup, Airbnb!

I'm also looking forward to meeting everyone else in my cohort (Cohort 20), they'll be the ones deep in the Data Science trenches with me for the next 3-months and will be a great network to have in SF for the future!

<sub>_P.S. - I created this site and blog at the beginning of the year, but as you can see I didn't write much of anything since then. Like [I said](http://nnamdioffor.com/2016/02/10/hello-space-monkey/) the hard part is sitting down to write. Hoping to change that, now that I have something to write about. 
<br>I plan to post weekly as I progress through the Galvanize and Airbnb programs, and hope that sharing my experience here will be useful to someone reading... or something like that._</sub>
